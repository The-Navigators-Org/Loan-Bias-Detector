# Loan-Bias-Detector

AI-powered system to detect and visualize bias in automated loan approval decisions.
Built using Streamlit for the Google Solution Challenge under the Responsible AI theme.



## Problem Statement

Automated decision systems in finance may introduce bias based on gender, income, education, or other demographic factors.
This project detects and visualizes bias in loan approval datasets to ensure fairness.


## Features

* Data Cleaning (Missing values, duplicates)
* Bias Detection across categorical attributes
* Fairness Score calculation
* Interactive Visualizations
* Automatic column selection
* Numeric data distribution analysis
* Streamlit Dashboard UI


## Tech Stack

* Python
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Dataset

Financial Loan Approval Dataset (from Kaggle)


## Installation

Clone repository:

git clone https://github.com/The-Navigators-Org/Loan-Bias-Detector.git

cd responsible-ai-loan-bias-detector

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run application:

streamlit run app.py

## How It Works

1. Load dataset
2. Clean missing values
3. Detect categorical columns
4. Generate bias comparison
5. Calculate fairness score
6. Visualize numeric distributions

## Fairness Score Formula

Fairness = 1 - (max approval rate - min approval rate)

Higher score means less bias.
